# About the Project
MoodFlix is a web application that uses facial expression recognition to detect a userâ€™s emotions and age, and then suggests movies and shows based on these factors.

This personalized approach aims to enhance the movie-watching experience by recommending films that align with the user's current mood and preferred genre.
